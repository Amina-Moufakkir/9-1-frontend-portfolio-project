        <p>I am currently training to be a Software Developer at Pursuit, an intensive 12- month software engineering fellowship with a 9 % acceptance rate. My interest in tech started with a simple desire to learn graphic design and has since grown to love technologies that make graphic design possible. 
            Having worked in the airline industry for twelve years in Morocco, I was craving more opportunities to grow and develop but soon realized that after ten years, I had taken advantage of them all. From that moment on, I knew I had to find a new passion, and that's when I started learning about graphic design. I started teaching myself, so my passion for programming grew and led me to pursue a career in the tech industry. 
            As a Pursuit Fellow, I am learning JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node, and React for front-end development and Express and PostgreSQL for backend development.
            Technology is everywhere, and the airline industry is a fertile area for research and improvements. technologies like blockchain, VR, face recognition, e-documentation, and more could have a crucial impact on passengers' and crew members' experiences.
